# Dupeeloopies

After working with my company at Achievers, I noticed that a lot of cases were duplicated. 

I created a code that allows users to insert a PDF with email info. My code will scan the PDF for duplicate emails and 
inform the user which emails are mentioned multiple times.

The user can then find the assoicated case numbers manually and merge the cases into one.

In essence, if my code finds 2 emails, you actually have 4 open cases. This will halve however many extra cases are opened
for the same reason.

I created this code to make it easier on my fellow coworkers to not have to work on cases that are pre-existing
